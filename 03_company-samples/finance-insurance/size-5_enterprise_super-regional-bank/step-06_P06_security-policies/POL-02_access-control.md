## 4. Policy statements
Each statement is testable and tagged with its SP 800-53 control(s) and CSF 2.0 subcategory. `policy-control-map.csv` traces each statement to its regulatory driver and shows whether Internal Audit tested it in 2026 (P07).

4.1 Every user, service, and customer must have a unique identity. Shared workforce accounts are prohibited. Service accounts must be registered to an owner, vaulted, certified quarterly, and must not have non-expiring passwords. (IA-2; AC-2; IA-5; PR.AA-01)
4.2 Access must be role-based, least-privilege, and approved by the manager or system owner before it is granted. (AC-2; AC-3; AC-6; PR.AA-05)
4.3 Duties that would let one person create and release a payment, or maintain beneficiary templates and approve wires, must be separated; every outgoing wire requires maker-checker. (AC-5; PR.AA-05)
4.4 MFA is required for all workforce access. Privileged users, and staff who handle client payment instructions, must use phishing-resistant authenticators. (IA-2(1); IA-2(2); PR.AA-03)
4.5 Access must be removed on every system, including the mainframe, the same business day as a termination, and immediately for involuntary terminations. (PS-4; AC-2; PR.AA-05)
4.6 Workforce accounts inactive for 60 days must be disabled automatically. (AC-2(3); PR.AA-05)
4.7 Managers must certify their staff's access every quarter, including mainframe entitlements and service identities. (AC-2; PR.AA-05)
4.8 Privileged access, including mainframe system privileges, must be granted just in time through PAM, recorded, and limited to the approved window. (AC-6; AC-6(9); PR.AA-05)
4.9 Remote workforce and vendor access must go through the zero-trust or PAM gateway with approval and session recording. (AC-17; PR.AA-05)
4.10 Customers must use MFA in digital and treasury channels. SMS one-time passcodes may be used only as a fallback. Adding a payee or beneficiary, raising a limit, or changing contact data requires step-up authentication, including on trusted devices. (IA-8; IA-11; PR.AA-03)
4.11 Payment instructions or changes received by email, phone, or fax must be verified by a callback to the number on file, performed by the callback team, before execution. Every new wire beneficiary in treasury channels must be confirmed out of band, regardless of amount. (IA-11; SI-4; PR.AA-03)
4.12 Two sealed break-glass accounts per critical platform must exist, be tested quarterly, and have every use reviewed by the Director of Cyber Defense. (AC-2; PR.AA-05)
